# Collection

In the Collection tab you can browse all cards available in the game. We try to maintain it as updated as possible using [our metadata parser](https://github.com/mtgatool/MTG-Arena-Tool-Metadata), which takes cards data straight from MTG Arena.

In this tab you can find any card, be it by text search or by using the column filters. One commonly used filter is the boosters filter:

![Boosters Filter](../../images/docs/collection-filter-boosters.png)

Enable the Red marker to allow *any* card to show in the results. Enable the Green marker to allow cards that can only be obtained by cracking booster packs. 

You can also change the View mode to see different aspects of your collection. For example, using the Sets View allows you to see in detail how many boosters you need to open to complete sets, or know (approximately) how many drafts you have to play before you can start cracking packs, to optimize the ammount of play you need in order to complete all mythics or rares in each set:

Depending on the filters you set all parts of the Collection tab will update to represent them. For example, selecting just one Set will make the right side panel show the statistics only for that set. The same applies for any other filter like colors, rarity and even text search.

## Wanted Cards

Decks in your [Decks tab](./decks) that contain cards you do not possess will add these cards to your "Wanted" cards list. Wanted cards are shown as blue diamonds in the collection tab. We highly recommend having decks in MTG Arena specifically for this purpose, and edit it whenever necessary, so you can see its changes and keep your collection more organized.
