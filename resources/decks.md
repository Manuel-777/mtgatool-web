# Decks Tab

Here you will find all decks you have with in MTG Arena.

![Archive Deck](deck-archive)

You can open any deck to see common stats like mana curve, types count and wildcards. You can also export and share that deck in this screen.

Once open, on the right side panel you can see this deck's winrate and statistics based on the filters set on the previous screen (but only for this deck)

![Deck View](deck-view)

> **Note:** The "Export to .txt" button will export on the format set in Settings > Behaviour > "Export Format", while the "Export to Arena" button will copy the deck to the clipboard so you can paste it into Arena.
