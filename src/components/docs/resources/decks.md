# Decks Tab

Here you will find all decks you have or had in MTG Arena, **any deck** you built in the game will appear here even after you delete it from the game, be it from drafts or limited sessions too.

You can Archive decks in this tab if they have the archive button on the right, this will only appear if the deck is no longer present in the game.

# Wanted Cards

Decks added here that contain cards you do not posses will add to your "Wanted" cards list. These cards will count in collection tab for those means. We highly recommend having decks in MTG Arena for this purpose, and edit it whenever necessary, so you can see its changes and keep it organized.
