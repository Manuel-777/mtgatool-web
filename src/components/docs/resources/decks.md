# Decks Tab

Here you will find all decks you have or had in MTG Arena, **any deck** you built in the game will appear here even after you delete it from the game, be it from drafts or limited sessions too.

You can Archive decks in this tab if they have the archive button on the right, this will only appear if the deck is no longer present in the game, as shown below;

![Archive Deck](deck-archive)

You can open any deck to see common stats like mana curve, types count and wildcards. You can also export and share that deck in this screen.

Once open, on the right side panel you can see this deck's winrate and statistics based on the filters set on the previous screen (but only for this deck)

![Deck View](deck-view)

> **Note:** The "Export to .txt" button will export on the format set in Settings > Behaviour > "Export Format", while the "Export to Arena" button will copy the deck to the clipboard so you can paste it into Arena.
