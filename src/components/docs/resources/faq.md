# Frequently Asked Questions

## Where can I submit issues / suggestions?

We are always on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/K9bPkJy), but we use [GitHub issues tracker](https://github.com/Manuel-777/MTG-Arena-Tool/issues) too.

## I get a black window.

This is a renderer error. We do our best to catch these but some are simply fatal and crash the window. To debug (to know what happened, send a report so we can take a look) open dev tools pressing `Alt + Shift + D`, and on the devtools that is attached to the window seek the "Console" tab and look for the **red** errors.
