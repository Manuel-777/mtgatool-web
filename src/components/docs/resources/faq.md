# Frequently Asked Questions

# Where do Draft ranks come from?

We used [Magic Community Set Rewview](https://www.mtgcommunityreview.com/) up until Theros: Beyond Death. But since they will no longer publish their reviews we moved with JustLolaMan, Moebius and Scottynada's ratings. They are all excellent, top tier drafters and friends of us! check their Twitch Channels if you're interested;

[M0bieus](https://www.twitch.tv/M0bieus)
[Scottynada](https://www.twitch.tv/Scottynada)

## Where can I submit issues / suggestions?

We are always on [our Discord](https://discord.gg/K9bPkJy), but we use [GitHub issues tracker](https://github.com/Manuel-777/MTG-Arena-Tool/issues) too.

## I get a black window.

This is a renderer error. We do our best to catch these but some are simply fatal and crash the window. To debug (to know what happened, send a report so we can take a look) open dev tools pressing `Alt + Shift + D`, and on the devtools that is attached to the window seek the "Console" tab and look for the **red** errors.

## Black Overlays / Black screen with overlays enabled

To fix this issue, if you are on Windows you should enable Transparency (on Windows 10) or Aero Effects on Windows 7 and Vista. If your PC does not support transparency overlays will not function correctly.
