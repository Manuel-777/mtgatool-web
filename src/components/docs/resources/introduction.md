# Introduction

Welcome to our Documentation! here you will find all resources you need to get started with the app and (hopefully) answer any questions you might have about its features and functionality. All of these docs are [open source](https://github.com/mtgatool/mtgatool-web/), we love corrections and improvements!

To describe it quickly, MTG Arena Tool is a collection viewer, deck tracker and statistics manager. But thats fair and simple, and under those words we hide a lot of features;
- In-game deck tracking overlay
  - Action log
  - Cards seen
  - Draft helper
  - Odds of card drawing
- Winrate viewer, with filters of colors, deck, formats, events and more!
- Collection viewer
- Collection completion estimator (for drafters)
- Match History (with filters!)
- Events History

# Bugs

Bugs in the app can be submitted directly to [our Discord](https://discord.gg/K9bPkJy) or to [GitHub issues tracker](https://github.com/Manuel-777/MTG-Arena-Tool/issues), we prefer the later so we can have it persisted, but we also love chatting to our users!

If an update of MTG Arena broke everything, we feel you. You can inspect GitHub Issues if the issue in question has already been submitted or Discord, we try to fix these as quickly as it is humanly possible and we got quite good at it, but some times things break unexpectedly and it can take some time for us to figure out something was not working.
