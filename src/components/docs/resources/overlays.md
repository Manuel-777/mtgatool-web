# Overlays

In MTG Arena Tool you can enable up to 5 different overlays at the same time, and each one can have its own mode and settings, currently available modes are;

- **Full Deck:** Shows your complete deck without changing the ammount of cards.
- **Library:** Shows your library on its current state, removing cards as you play them
- **Next Draw:** Show the probability for your next draw of certain types of cards, like Lands or Instants. You can toggle the sample size of the draw to be more than just the next draw.
- **Library and Odds:** Shows your library on its current state, like Library mode, but includes the odds of drawing the cards along with the quantities.
- **Opponent:** Shows only the cards your opponent played
- **Draft Pick:** Draft helper mode, shows rankings for cards in the current pack, the number of cards you own of each and allows you to see previous packs.
- **Draft Brew:** Shows your current draft pool/picks.
- **Action Log:** Shows the action log for this match as events happen, in a human-readable manner.

# Black Overlays

To fix this issue, if you are on Windows you should enable Transparency (on Windows 10) or Aero Effects on Windows 7 and Vista. If your PC does not support transparency overlays will not function correctly.
